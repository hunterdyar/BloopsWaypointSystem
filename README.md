The [Unity Splines Package](https://blog.unity.com/technology/building-better-paths-with-splines-in-2022-2) seems to be pretty good now.

# Bloops Waypoint System


Dead simple waypoint system for Unity. 



Trying to take some common code ive been copying and pasting between jam projects and make some packages out of them. Starting with this one because its the simplest..



Basically just an editor script that draws arrows and lines for waypoints on a path.



Waypoints do not have to be children of the path object, so children are not grabbed automatically.
